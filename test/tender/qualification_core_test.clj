  "Why this repository's `.kotoba` cores are NOT delegated to a KIR oracle.

  ADR-2608112100 set the completion condition for a Kotoba core: a core with a
  parity test is not migrated; the host has to execute the shipped artifact.
  The seam that satisfies it — id -> shipped `<id>.kir.edn` -> `kotoba.kir/execute`
  — exists in several repositories now (`cloud-itonami-app`, `calendar`, `crdt`,
  `murakumo`, `kotoba-selfhost-contracts`), and the obvious next question for
  this one is why it does not exist here.

  It is not an omission. It is the boundary that same ADR states in its own
  Consequences, about the three cores it had just delegated:

      delegation is not tender. It is in-process interpretation through the KIR
      interpreter, with no capability gate and no supervisor. Those three cores
      are kotoba/pure, so there is nothing to gate. A core that carries an
      effect is where tender begins.

  This repository is where tender begins. Its cores are the qualification
  fixtures for `kototama.tender`'s capability-gated Component host, and ten of
  the eleven declare a capability — one per admitted operation. Running them
  through a KIR oracle would take the components whose entire purpose is to
  prove the gate works and run them with no gate.

  These tests are the gate on that reasoning. They fail if someone gives an
  effectful core an in-process seam, and they fail if a core's declared
  authority changes without this file changing with it."
