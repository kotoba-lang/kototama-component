  "Two closed sets decide which aiueos imports a Component may have, and they
  are written in two languages.

    kototama/src/kototama/aiueos_adapter.clj
      `component-import->kototama-import`, described as \"a closed map: an
      unknown Component import is never translated to ambient WASI or a
      best-effort host binding.\"

    native/component-host/src/bin/tender-resident-component-host.rs
      `allowed_binding`, whose caller bails with \"unrecognized aiueos
      Component import\" on anything absent from it.

  Measured 2026-08-11, they overlap on three names and disagree on eleven.

  Whether that is intended is not written down anywhere. The README says the
  resident host is deliberately a separate authority surface \"keeping that
  authority surface out of the typed v0.3 protocol host\", and that with a
  SHA-pinned configuration it links only the HTTP, storage and LLM imports for
  the cloud-itonami effect chain — which explains a NARROWER set. It does not
  explain `aiueos-llm-generate` and `aiueos-storage-transact`, which the
  resident host admits and which appear nowhere in kototama's source at all.

  So this test does not assert that the two agree. It PINS the current
  relationship, so that a change to either side has to state which of the two
  it meant:

    * widening the resident host — a new name here must be justified against
      kototama's closed map, or added to it;
    * changing kototama — a name removed there must be removed here too, or
      the resident host keeps admitting an import the translator no longer
      knows.

  Neither side is edited by this test. Making a divergence visible is the
  point; deciding it is the owner's."
